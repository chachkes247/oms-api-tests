# oms-api-tests
This repository contains automated tests and a CI/CD pipeline for validating the Order Management System (OMS) used in an e-commerce platform. The OMS enables customers to place and track orders while allowing administrators to manage order statuses through a RESTful API built with FastAPI and MongoDB.
